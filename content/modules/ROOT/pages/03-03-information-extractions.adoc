= Information Extraction
include::_attributes.adoc[]

As part of our claim processing, we want to extract some information from the text of a complaint. In the next notebook we will investigate how the LLM can be used to do this task.

From the `sentiments/lab-materials/03` folder, please open the notebook called `03-03-information-extraction.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.

== Introduction

Now that we have retrained our model we can test it against some sample images.

We have converted our model to onnx format and placed a copy within an S3 bucket. We will test this version against some sample test images.

Using the re-trained model, we will see that we are able to identify a bag. The idea is to understand how to do training and inference.

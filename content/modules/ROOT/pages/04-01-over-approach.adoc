As part of this prototype, we investigated the use of the YOLOv8 model.
This model can be found online at https://www.yolov8.com[yolov8,window=_blank] and downloaded.

== [NOTE]
We could get proper images of baggages to have a yolov8 model for baggage damage detection, hence we are using car in this case to identify the damage. The concept remains same for detecting damage of baggage.

== Image Processing Sections

. We will first review its out-of-the-box capabilities.
. We will then fine-tune it to allow it to do more specialized work for us.
. Once we have a new, customized version of the model, we will deploy it in {rhoai} Model Serving.
. Once that is done, we will send queries to it.

== Image Processing Out-of-the-box capabilities

Let's start by looking at a YOLOv8 model and explore how it works on static bag images.

- Go to your OpenShift AI jupyterhub notebook tab on your browser.
- Open the Launcer and terminal window.

- Go to sentiments folder and do a `git pull`
- Then go back to your folder `sentiments/lab-materials/04`
- Look for (and open) the notebook called `04-01-over-approach.ipynb`.
- Execute the cells of the notebook, and ensure you understand what is happening.

* Baggage Claims can come in from multiple mediums:
** email
** fax
** phone
** web form
* All formats will have to be transcribed into the web form for better uniformity

* Baggage Claims have to be processed by (human) claims adjusters or remotely reviewed to ensure that the claims are genuine.
* There are a lot of inefficiencies!
** Adjusters report "workload-fatigue", i.e. making mistakes due to the repetitive nature of the work.
** It also takes a long time to train new adjusters into the specific policies of the companies.
** Encoding some of that tribal knowledge into a software product is highly desirable.

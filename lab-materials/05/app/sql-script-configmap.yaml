    Hi Indigo Airlines,
    
    I hope this email finds you well. My name is Parth Sharma, and I am writing to file a claim for my flight from Mumbai to Delhi on March 31, 2024. My PNR is 9W5TY76.

    at 12.20 PM from Mumbai to Gwalior and at 11.00 am, I am receiving a message that my flight has been cancelled and there are no other flights later in the day!!.\n\n Do you guys understand the importance of bookings? Canâ€™t you keep few hours delay and arrange the flight? Stupid reasons for your inefficiency weather is now under controlled. In case the situation was

    so worse it should have been informed to the passengers last night itself, so that they would made some arrangements or plan accordingly, just informing before 2 hours is highly irresponsible and passengers were already at the airport. The airport staff was rude and haggled the passengers unnecesarily. 

        
    Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to a swift resolution of this claim.

    Sincerely,

    Hi Indigo,

    I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the appalling service I have received on my last flight. This is regarding my baggage that got damaged during my flight from Guwahati to Delhi on July 2, 2024. 
    
    The luggage had my clothes and some luxury perfumes which broke. The suitcase is now completely damaged. To make matters worse, the on-ground staff refused to acknowledge the damage and said the suitcase was probably 
    
    broken before. I am sending a mail to the Ministry of Aviation as well regarding this. The entire experience is extremely dissapointing specially for someone who is a frequent flyer with Indigo since your inception days. 
    
    Please look into the same. I will personally make sure that neither me nor my family/friends will fly Indigo if no action is taken into this. 
    
    Sincerely,

    Dear Indigo Airlines,

    I hope this email finds you well.
    
    My name is Mohit Jain and I am wrtiting a small appreciation note for you people. Every time I fly Indigo, you people surprise me with a note and a little present. Almost to the point that if I donâ€™t get one, it would be a surpriseðŸ˜œ 
    
    This is not a flex but rather some observations I glean from experiences like this. A complementary sandwich & a juice are just what you need after a long day and shows customers how you care & makes them feel special. Indigo also brings out the letter and the gift on a 
    
    tray making it visible to others and sending a signal that celebs fly with us too. This builds the airlinesâ€™ aspirational positioning. While everything these days is snapped for social media, these little initiatives usually end up as a post as well, like this one. 
    
    So thanks once again for the fantastic service. Looking forward to flying again and having the Blue Tea again soon.

    Sincerely,

    Mohit Jain

    Hi Indigo,

    I am absolutely *thrilled* (read: infuriated) to be writing yet another heartfelt missive to the void that is your customer service. I am writing to complaint a claim 
    
    for a recent flight I took from Bengaluru to Nashik. I caught the flight on June 9th, 2024, at  3:30 PM. My PNR number is L89P2T.\n\n I wanted to report about an incident that took 
    
    place during the flight. I had pre-ordered and paid for a Chicken Junglee sandwich. However, the cabin staff told that the Chicken Junglee Sandwich was out of stock and fhence provided me an alternate meal. 
    
    The meal provided to me was a box of cashews and some cookies. The cookies received were stale and out of date. When I asked for a replacement, I was told this is all they have and they cannot provide anything else. 
    
    Not even a complimentary drink. The entire experience was not at all pleasant and the rude behaviour of the staff on-board was just not acceptful. It is shameful that a airlines of this pedigree provides such an experience to its flyers. 
    
    Please look into the same. I will personally make sure that neither me nor my family/friends will fly Indigo if no action is taken into this. 
    
    Looking forward to an expedited resolution.

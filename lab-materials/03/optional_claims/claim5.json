    "content": "Hi Indigo,\n\n Epic failure on IndiGo part to manage the slew of flight delays at Mumbai airport. My family and I had a flight to Hyderabad, PNR 66A88P3. Serpentine queues, outdated updates on screens which shows rescheduled and delayed flights as ‘taken off’, scanning machines not working. /n/n I guess now they will now incorporate ‘ value adds’ charges to ensure a seamless boarding 🧐. Horrific state of affairs. Not only did me and my family miss our flights, but also had to bear one day's expense of our hotel. No empathy shown from the on-ground staff. Not flying Indigo again.. Sincerely, Bhawani 123 Gurugram, Haryana 9650315897 bhawaniudaysingh@gmail.com"

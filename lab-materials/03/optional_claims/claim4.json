    "content": "Dear Indigo,\n\n My name is Alisha, and I am writing to complaint for my baggage that got damaged during my flight from Guwahati to Delhi on July 2, 2024. The luggage had my clothes and some luxury perfumes which broke. The suitcase is now completely damaged. /n/n To make matters worse, the on-ground staff refused to acknowledge the damage and said the suitcase was probably broken before. I am sending a mail to the Ministry of Aviation as well regarding this. The entire experience is extremely disappoitinitg specially for someone who is a frequent flyer with Indigo since your inception days.\n\n Please look into the same. I will personally make sure that neither me nor my family/friends will fly Indigo if no action is taken into this. Sincerely, Alisha 123 Bengaluru, Karnataka 8899006633 alishasingh@gmail.com"

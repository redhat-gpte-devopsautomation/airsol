    "content": "Dear Indigo,\n\n My name is Lavanya, and I am writing to complaint a claim for a recent flight I took from Bengaluru to Nashik. I caught the flight on June 9th, 2024, at  3:30 PM. My PNR number is 89PL2T1.\n\n I wanted to report about an incident that took place during the flight. I had pre-ordered and paid for a Chicken Junglee sandwich. However, the cabin staff told that the Chicken Junglee Sandwich was out of stock and fhence provided me an alternate meal. The meal provided to me was a box of cashews and some cookies. The cookies received were stale and out of date. When I asked for a replacement, I was told this is all they have and they cannot provide anything else. Not even a complimentary drink. The entire experience was not at all pleasant and the rude behaviour of the staff on-board was just not acceptful. It is shameful that a airlines of this pedigree provides such an experience to its flyers. Please look into the same. I will personally make sure that neither me nor my family/friends will fly Indigo if no action is taken into this. Sincerely, Lavanya 693 Bengaluru, Karnataka 9993388221 lavanyasingh@gmail.com"

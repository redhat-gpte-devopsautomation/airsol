    "content": "Dear Indigo,\n\n My name is Vikram Singh and I am wrtiting a small appreciation note for you people. Every time I fly Indigo, you people surprise me with a note and a little present. Almost to the point that if I donâ€™t get one, it would be a surpriseðŸ˜œ This is not a flex but rather some observations I glean from experiences like this. /n/n A packet of chips & cookies cost nothing but it shows customers you care & makes them feel special. Indigo also brings out the letter and the gift on a tray making it visible to others and sending a signal that celebs fly with us too. This builds the airlinesâ€™ aspirational positioning. While everything these days is snapped for social media, these little initiatives usually end up as a post as well, like this one. Sincerely, Vikram Singh 123 Gurugram, Haryana 990088331 vikramsingh@gmail.com"

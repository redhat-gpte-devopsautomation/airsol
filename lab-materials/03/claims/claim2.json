    "content": "Hi Indigo,\n\n My name is Amit, and I am writing to complaint for flight booked today on Jun 20, 2024 at 12.20 PM from Mumbai to Gwalior and at 11.00 am, I am receiving a message that my flight has been cancelled and there are no other flights later in the day!!.\n\n Do you guys understand the importance of bookings? Canâ€™t you keep few hours delay and arrange the flight? Stupid reasons for your inefficiency weather is now under controlled. In case the situation was so worse it should have been informed to the passengers last night itself, so that they would made some arrangements or plan accordingly, just informing before 2 hours is highly irresponsible and passengers were already at the airport. Sincerely, Amit 321 Nagpur, Maharashtra 999999999 amitjainh@gmail.com"

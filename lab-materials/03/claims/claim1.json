    "content": "Dear Indigo,\n\n My name is Siddarth, and I am writing to complaint a claim for a recent flight I took from Delhi to Cochin. I caught the flight on June 2nd, 2024, at  3:30 PM. My PNR number is 98LG5Y6.\n\n I wanted to report about an incident that took place during the flight. I had pre-ordered and paid for a Chicken Junglee sandwich. However, the cabin staff told that the Chicken Junglee Sandwich was out of stock and fhence provided me an alternate meal. The meal provided to me was a box of cashews and some cookies. The cookies received were stale and out of date. When I asked for a replacement, I was told this is all they have and they cannot provide anything else. Not even a complimentary drink. The entire experience was not at all pleasant and the rude behaviour of the staff on-board was just not acceptful. It is shameful that a airlines of this pedigree provides such an experience to its flyers. Please look into the same. I will personally make sure that neither me nor my family/friends will fly Indigo if no action is taken into this. Sincerely, Siddarth 123 Gurugram, Haryana 7799886633 engineeringgenuis@gmail.com"
